                        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Ferry Dermawan, a Fullstack Engineer currently working at <b>PT Tigace Inspirasi Indonesia</b>. This blog is my personal space to document what Iâ€™ve learned, encountered, or figured out in the world of tech. Think of it as my second brain â€” because letâ€™s face it, sometimes we forget things. Instead of searching the web over and over, Iâ€™d rather come back to my own notes.</p>
                        <p>Most of the content revolves around <b>PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, and DevOps</b>. From time to time, I also dive into other technologies that pique my interest. I aim to share information and tutorials that are practical and to the point, both for myself and anyone else who might stumble upon this blog.</p>
                        <p>If something here helps you out, thatâ€™s awesome! And if you feel like supporting my writing, feel free to visit the <Link href="/donate">/donate</Link> page â€” it might just fuel the next blog post. ðŸ˜„</p>
